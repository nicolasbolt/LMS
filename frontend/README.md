# Learning Management System

This is a work in progress project to showcase my abilities with React/NextJs. This will be a learning management system that allows students to sign up and complete courses.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
